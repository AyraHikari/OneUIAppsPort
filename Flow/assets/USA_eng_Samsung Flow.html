<br />
13. Dispute Resolution <br />
13.1 Choice of Law. These TOS, including all revisions and amendments thereto, are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles.<br />
13.2 Arbitration. By installing or otherwise using the SERVICE, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (i) any dispute (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against any Samsung entity, the officers, directors, agents and employees of any Samsung entity (the “Samsung Entity(ies)”) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the SERVICE or the determination of the scope or applicability of this clause, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, and not by a court or jury. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS and conducted before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS (which are available online at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267); (ii) this clause is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (iii) the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York; (iv) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of the TOS and any other agreements referenced herein that you have agreed to in connection with the SERVICE; (v) the arbitrator shall decide all issues of interpretation and application of this arbitration provision, shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (vi) ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL NOT BE COMBINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH A DISPUTE INVOLVING ANY OTHER PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S PRODUCT OR CLAIM, AND SPECIFICALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PROCEED AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION; (vii) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Samsung Entity; (viii) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Samsung Entity exceed Fifty US Dollars (US$50), and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Samsung shall pay the remainder of such fees. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Samsung will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost prohibitive; and (ix) with the exception of subsection (vi) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subsection (vi) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Samsung shall be entitled to arbitrate the dispute. YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION BY PROVIDING NOTICE TO SAMSUNG NO LATER THAN 30 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU INSTALL THE SERVICE. To opt out, you must send notice by e-mail to optout@sea.samsung.com, with the subject line: “ARBITRATION OPT OUT.” You must include in the opt out e-mail (a) your name and address; (b) the date on which the Service was installed; and (c) the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number, as applicable, for the device on which the Service was installed. Alternatively, you may opt out by calling 1-800-SAMSUNG (726-7864) no later than 30 calendar days from the date you first install the Service and providing the same information. These are the only two forms of notice that will be effective to opt out of this dispute resolution provision.

<br />
14. Entire Agreement<br />
These TOS are the entire agreement between you and Samsung relating to the SERVICE and supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the SERVICE or any other subject matter covered by these TOS. If any provision of these TOS is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect.<br />
<br />
